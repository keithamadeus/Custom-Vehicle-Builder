  ## Installation
  npm i inquirer
  npm start

  ## Usage
  Understanding Importance: Working with TypeScript highlighted the critical role of strict typing in software development. Initially, it might seem restrictive compared to JavaScript's flexibility, but TypeScript's type system acts like a safety net. It catches errors at compile-time rather than runtime, which was incredibly beneficial. This project showed me how strict typing prevents common bugs like null pointer exceptions or type mismatches, which are often discovered too late in JavaScript projects.    

  ## Learning Points
  Enhanced Code Readability: By defining types explicitly, I found that the code became self-documenting. Reading let engine: Engine = new V8Engine(); immediately tells you what engine is, reducing the need for extensive comments or documentation.

  Object-Oriented Principles in Practice:
  Classes and Objects: Implementing the car builder with classes allowed me to encapsulate behavior and data. Each class (like Engine, Wheels, etc.) was a blueprint that could be instantiated with specific properties, demonstrating encapsulation and instantiation.    

  Inheritance and Polymorphism: 
  Through inheritance, I created a hierarchy where Motorbike could extend Vehicle, showcasing how inheritance allows for code reuse and specialization. Polymorphism came into play when different Vehicle types could be used interchangeably, thanks to their shared interface or base class.
  Interfaces and Types: Using interfaces like Driveable helped define contracts that classes must adhere to, promoting polymorphism and making the code more maintainable. This practice taught me how interfaces enforce a certain structure across different parts of the application.

  Utilizing Node Packages - Inquirer:
  Package Integration: Installing and using Inquirer was an eye-opener to the vast ecosystem of Node.js. It showed how external libraries can extend the functionality of your project without reinventing the wheel. Inquirer provided an elegant way to handle user input, which was crucial for the interactive nature of the car builder.
  Real-World Application: This exposure wasn't just about using a package; it was about understanding how to integrate third-party libraries into an OOP structure. It involved managing dependencies, understanding package documentation, and adapting external code to fit within my class-based architecture.

  Learning Package Management: Working with npm (Node Package Manager) taught me about dependency management, version control for packages, and how to resolve conflicts or updates in dependencies, which is a critical skill in modern development.

  Overall Impact on Development Skills:
  Discipline in Coding: TypeScript and OOP principles instilled a discipline in my coding practices. It's not just about writing code that works; it's about writing code that's maintainable, scalable, and understandable by others.
  Problem-Solving: This project enhanced my ability to think in terms of objects, their relationships, and how to model real-world scenarios programmatically.    
  Future Projects: The skills and insights gained will undoubtedly influence how I approach future projects, emphasizing planning, typing, and modular design from the outset.
  This expanded section not only explains what you've learned but also reflects on how these learnings will influence your future coding endeavors, making your README.md more insightful and valuable for readers.
